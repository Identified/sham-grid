###About
SOh noes! Not another grid!?!?.

Well, yes... and no. Is not a full-featured grid. It's actually a simpler way to get responsive and flexible versions of three most common layouts â€” a fat column with a sidebar, two equal columns, and three equal columns. You can use these patterns repeatedly to acheive anything you like.

###Usage
